_ROOTS_DESCRIPTION :: String =
  "\nYou stand among the roots of Yggradsil, the world tree.\n\
  \Its bark is tougher than steel, and older than the universe.\n\
  \On and on it stretches upwards, farther than you could possibly ever see.\n\
  \High above you lie the great planes and all of their inhabitants. You feel very tiny indeed.\n\n\
  \Just barely, but you can distinguish MIDGARD, the mortal plane. There shepards tend to their flocks, \n\
  \farmers till their fields, fishermen mend their nets, and warriors sharpen their swords...\n\n\
  \From another branch, somewhat below Midgard, you feel a great burning heat, as if an hungy fire raged \n\
  \across the skies, wishing to consume all. Still, the world tree does not burn; its time has not yet come.\n\
  \This must be MUSPELHEIM, land of the fire giants. It is a place where even the gods fear to thread, and only a fool \n\
  \would wander unprepared. Yet are the greatest rewards not reaped by the greatest risks?\n\n\
  \A cold wind hits your shoulders: you turn and gaze upon HELHEIM, land of the dead. To your living body,\n\
  \it feels murky and incomprehensible. Do you fear death? \n\n\
  \Even further down than Helheim, at the very end of the tree (does the world tree ever end?) you seem to \n\
  \distinguish a clear LAKE, and a light shining brilliantly from its center. What could possibly be there?\n\n"

_MIDGARD_DESCRIPTION :: String =
  "\nYou have arrived in Midgard, the land of mortal men.\n\
  \Breathing comes easily here, and the sun shines upon your face. Overall, it is quite pleasant.\n\n\
  \The most magnificent sight of all lies before your eyes: the great rainbow bridge connecting Midgard to ASGARD,\n\
  \home of the Gods. Who knows what wanders lie beyond?\n\n\
  \A faint but intoxicating music reaches your ears. It is so beautiful as to be almost painful,\n\
  \and brings whispers of ALVHEIM, the fair realm of the elves." -- \n\n\
  -- \As you gaze downward on the land you see a host of warriors preparing for battle; they are laying siege to a CITY\n\
  -- \of colossal size. Its walls are so tall they seem to scrape the sky, and the rooftops of its many palaces shine\n\
  -- \as if made of gold. There must be great riches to be claimed and glory to be won."

_MUSPELHEIM_DESCRIPTION :: String =
  "\nYou've reached the borders of Muspelheim, land of the fire giants. The ground is covered by a thick layer of ash,\n\
  \and scarred by rivers of lava. You struggle to breathe, and the sky is blackened by the smoke from the many raging fires.\n\
  \Here and there you see giants clothed in flames going about their way.\n\
  \At the top of a mountain, sitting on a trone of black stone is SURTR, king of the giants.\n\
  \\n\nAnother branch extends downwards, away from the inferno. That must be SWARTELHEIM, of which you've heard legends."

_SURTR_FIGHT :: String =
  "\nYou stand before the king of the giants, the one who will eveventually burn\n\
  \the world. He does not rise to greet you, and merely continues to polish the shining sword laying on his lap.\n\
  \At his feet lie the skulls of a thousand brave adventurers. He looks at you and smiles."

_SURTR_VICTORY :: String =
  "\nThe king of the giants bows before you, recognizing a hero of true valor. Not even the god of thunder\n\
  \can claim to have ever defeated the child of fire. He will remeber the day until ythe end of times."

_SWARTELEIM_DESCRIPTION :: String =
  "\nYou have reached Swartelheim, land of the dwarves. This strange creatures are not much larger than a child,\n\
  \and yet posses the strength to mine the rocks tirelessly in search of precious\n\
  \metals with which to fashion tools of unparalleled quality. You see a CAVE in the distance.\n\
  \Perhaps you could bargain with a dwarf for his treasure?"

_CAVE_VICTORY_TEXT :: String =
  "\nThe treasure of the dragon piles up to the ceiling, but you know better than to steal a dwarf's gold,\n\
  \lest you be turned into a monster too by their powerful curses."

_CAVE_FIGHT_TEXT :: String =
  "\nA dwarf lies crying about the entrance. The dragon Fafnir has stolen his hoard.\n\
  \Were you to defeat the fearsome beast, perhaps you might receive some great work of dwarven craft as a gift.\n\
  \The dragon gives you no time to think, and rushes at you with fire and fang."

_ALVEHIM_DESCRIPTION :: String =
  "\nYou've reached Alvheim, land of the elves.\n\
  \Everything is bliss, and the elves discuss among themsleves great works of magic and poetry.\n\
  \A whole crowd surrounds FEANOR, the cleverest among the fair creatures.\n\n\
  \Further up the tree, you catch a glimpse of VANHEIM, where all magic comes from."

_FEANOR_VICTORY :: String =
  "\nNever would have Feanor believed that one day he would be surpassed by a mortal.\n\
  \He bows before your intellect."

_FEANOR_FIGHT :: String =
  "\nThe elf is deep into work: from the feathers of a falcon he's fashioning a cape\n\
  \that can give its wearer the gift of flight. He can't be bothered to speak to those\n\
  \who haven't proven themselves to be worthy of his time."

_VANHEIM_DESCRIPTION :: String =
  "\nYou have reached Vanheim, home of the Vanir, brothers and foes of the Gods,\n\
  \masters of magic. Where did they come from?"

_VANHEIM_LOCK :: String = "\nThat branch is impossibly high. If only you could fly..."

_ASGARD_LOCK :: String =
  "\nHeimdall, Warden of the Gods, bids you to halt.\n\
  \Only a hero hailed three times champion may walk the Bifrost. Bring him proof of your valor."

_LAKE_DESCRIPTION :: String =
  "\nHere you are, at the furthermost corner of the Tree anybody has ever explored. Even the Allfather never\n\
  \never went beyond this point. The water in the pool is impossibly clear, and yet startngly blue.\n\
  \Even from here you cannot tell what the source of the light at the center is.\n\
  \Perhaps you should wade in and take a closer look?"
