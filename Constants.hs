_ROOTS_MSG :: String = "You stand among the roots of Yggradsil, the world tree.\n 
                        Its bark is tougher than steel, and older than the universe; \n 
                        on and on it stretches upwards, farther than you could possibly ever see. 
                        You feel very tiny indeed.\n\n
                        
                        High above you lie the great planes and all of their inhabitants.\n
                        Just barely, but you can distinguish MIDGARD, the mortal plane. There shepards tend to their flocks, \n
                        farmers till their fields, fishermen mend their nets, and warriors sharpen their swords...\n\n
                        
                        From another branch, somewhat below Midgard, you feel a great burning heat, as if an hungy fire raged \n
                        across the skies, wishing to consume all. Still, the world tree does not burn; its time has not yet come.
                        This must be MUSPELHEIM, land of the fire giants. There even the gods fear to thread, and only a fool \n 
                        would wander unprepared. Are the greatest rewards not reaped by the greatest risks?\n\n

                        A cold wind hits your shoulders: you turn and gaze upon HELHEIM, land of the dead. To your living body, \n
                        it feels murky and incomprehensible. Do you fear death? \n\n

                        Even further down then Helheim, at the very end of the tree (does the world tree ever end?) you seem to \n
                        distinguish a clear LAKE, and a light shining brilliantly from its center. What could possibly be there?
